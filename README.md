## How to use this repository

1. Just underneath the repository description you’ll see a clock symbol with a number of "commits". Click on that or click [here](https://github.com/LikeJasper/javascript-tutorial-1/commits/master).
1. You'll get taken to a page which lists all of the commits (snapshots) of the files which make up the todo app. Later commits are listed first. To see the first commit you’ll have to click on "Older" at the bottom of the page.
1. Next to each commit is a clipboard symbol, a series of 7 letters/numbers, and a symbol which looks like `<>`. If you click on `<>` you can see the repository as it looked when that commit was made (ie what the files were like when that snapshot was taken).
1. Work through each commit, adding the changes you see to the `index.html` and `todos.js` files. Eventually you’ll get a basic todo app!
